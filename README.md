# chip8-ti68k
A CHIP-8 interpreter for the TI-68k series of calculators (TI-89, TI-89 Titanium, TI-92 Plus, Voyage 200).

This project is incomplete and non-functional. If somehow you gain access to this source code, you are encouraged to contribute to the project by directly contacting the author, but not to execute any resulting binaries. If you do so, understand that you are likely to corrupt your calculator's ram.

**TODO:**

[x]  Create a functional rom preprocessor so that testing can begin.

[ ]  Make it work without crashing. **(Important)**

[ ]	Create an inturupt based timing function.

[ ]	Add TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 keyboard compatibility.

[ ]	Polish.

[ ]	Add support for various CHIP-8 extentions.

[ ]	Polish even more.


**Credits go to:**

The Ti Chess Team (TICT) for their work on the TIGCC Tools Suite, part of which is integrated into the preprocessor code. Go check them out here: [tict.ticalc.org](https://tict.ticalc.org)
